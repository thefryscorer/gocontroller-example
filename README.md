# Description

This program serves as an example of what the [GoController](github.com/thefryscorer/gocontroller) library is capable of, and a general reference for programming customised controllers using the library.
The controller is hosted locally as a webpage, which can then be accessed using any browser- mobile or otherwise- to control games over the network.

# Dependencies

Currently only works with Linux with the xte binary installed, I am looking into making it work for Windows, possibly utilising system calls to autohotkey.
